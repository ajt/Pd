#X text 59 23 Natural reverberation is a product of complex sound reflections
patterns \, where a sound source keeps moving and bouncing around innumerous
spots in a room/space. This can be digitally modeled with delay lines.
Ideally \, we'd need thousands of delay lines to properly model every
possible reflection \, but there are efficient techniques that involve
less delay lines with good results., f 64;
