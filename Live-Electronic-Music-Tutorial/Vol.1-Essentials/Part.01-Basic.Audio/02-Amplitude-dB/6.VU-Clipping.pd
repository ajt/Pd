#X text 25 26 Setting a maximum value of 0 dB is a practice that comes
from the usage of "Volume Meters" (VU) in analog audio. This device
is calibrated so that 0 dB is the maximum value it can handle without
distorting. In digital audio we have the same thing \, but digital
distortion is a special type \, known as "clipping"., f 66;
#X text 25 115 The maximum peak amplitude is 1 (0 dBFS). Greater values
are "clipped" \, which means they become 1 as that's the maximum representable
value. In practice \, we have resulting waves that are a bit square
(see below the graphical representation of clipping)., f 66;
#X text 516 26 Within Pd we can still have values outside the -1 to
1 range. It is in the digital to analog conversion that the clipping
occurs. Pd has a native [vu] object that is a kind of VU Meter \, but
it doesn't really perform any signal analysys. Now the [vu~] object
from ELSE analyses a signal and we can feed its output to [vu]., f
66;
#X text 516 112 The [vu] object accepts both peak and RMS amplitudes.
See below to the left how it can still represent values over 0 dB \,
but note also how they become red \, as a sign of "DANGER"! Or "warning
\, this is being clipped"., f 66;
#X obj 837 253 noise~;
#X text 517 180 Below \, to the right \, we have other objects from
ELSE \, [meter~] and [meter2~] \, which are convenient abstractions
based on [vu~] and [vu] that automatically performs analysis on the
input signals., f 66;
