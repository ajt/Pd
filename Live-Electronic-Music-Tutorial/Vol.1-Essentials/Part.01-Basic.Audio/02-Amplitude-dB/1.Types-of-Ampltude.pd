#X text 31 17 The amplitude of a sound represents the sound source's
wave propagation \, as in the motion of your speakers., f 54;
#X text 31 57 There are different types of amplitude concept. The "running
amplitude" refers to the dynamic amplitude signal output such as the
signal of any sound generator in Pd. Like an oscillator's \, for instance.

#X text 36 357 On the other hand \, we can think of amplitude as one
single amplitude value \, which is called the "instant amplitude".

#X text 449 29 But an "instant amplitude" doesn't tell us much about
what's going on with the signal as a whole \, just that moment in time...
that's why we have other types of amplitude measures \, and all take
into account a time window. See the graph below:, f 62;
#X text 463 330 Above \, we have 3 different types of amplitude measurement
(represented in the graph as numbers 1 to 3). All of which depend on
a time window (represented as number 4). Let's see below which are
these 3 types of amplitude.;
#X text 508 401 1- "Peak Amplitude": Biggest difference to Zero (positive
or negative) in the time window, f 50;
#X text 508 437 2- "Peak to Peak": Difference between positive and
negative peaks in the time window, f 50;
#X text 508 473 3- "Root Mean Square" (RMS): A mean of all samples
in the time window, f 50;
