#X text 24 20 Nyquist's theorem says the highest frequency we can represent
(also called "nyquist frequncy") is half the sample rate. Higher frequencies
generate "Aliasing" or "Foldover". The [nyquist~] object \, from ELSE
\, reports the Nyquist Frequency.;
#X text 25 183 Let's imagine an over exagerated example \, where a
digital sound has an extremely low rate of 20Hz. Well \, a middle A
(with 440 hz) can never be represented in such a low rate.;
#X text 34 452 Above we have an illustration where the original frequency
signal (in red) is higher than the sample rate (which are represented
by the blue dots). The resulting blue signal is what we end up representing
and it has a lower frequency than the original.;
#X text 467 31 If the frequency starts passing over the Nyquist \,
it folds back and starts descending. For example \, in a Nyquist frequency
of 22.05 Khz \, 23.1 Khz becomes 21.1 Khz. Mathematically speaking:
, f 63;
#X text 519 97 Frequency = Nyquist - (Frequency - Nyquist);
#X text 467 142 This calculus is performed in the [fold] object from
ELSE. By default \, we're sending a frequency of 40 Khz to [osc~] \,
but the resulting oscillation has a frequency of 4.1 Khz. Change the
number values to try it out., f 63;
#X text 468 199 when the aliased frequency hits and passes 0 Hz \,
it folds back again and starts raising up.;
