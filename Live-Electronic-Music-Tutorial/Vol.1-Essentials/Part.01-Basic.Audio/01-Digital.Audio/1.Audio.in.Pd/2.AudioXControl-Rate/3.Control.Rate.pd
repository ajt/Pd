#X text 260 287 audio signal controlling the frequency, f 13;
#X text 48 124 The idea is that it's not necessary to have a high time
resolution for control data input. So we use control objects to control
the patch's parameters and save on CPU power. But there are cases where
control needs to be performed by audio signals at a high rate. This
means audio is also used to control parameters and that some audio
objects will have audio inputs for parameter control \, such as [osc~]
below \, which takes both control rate and audio rate to set the frequency.
;
#X text 49 425 This might be a little confusing \, as many expect audio
just to represent sound waves we listen to. But it's just a necessity
to have a high timing resolution. In the case of frequency input above
\, it's quite unnecessary \, but it would be for Frequency Modulation
\, as we'll see later on., f 62;
#X text 49 492 Ok \, so \, if normally there's a control rate that's
lower in resolution to the audio rate \, what is it normally? The answer
is that it depends on the system. Max/MSP has a default resolution
of 2 ms \, which can be set to as low as 1 ms. SuperCollider's control
rate depends on the block size and sample rate \, so a rate of 44.1
khz and a block of 64 samples defines a control rate of about 1.45
ms., f 62;
#X text 533 48 Now \, funny enough \, Pd has no fixed control rate.
This means control objects have no timing restrain and can be very
precise. Moreover \, they can operate in a higher rate than the sample
rate! However \, it'd be silly and useless to generate control values
at a rate higher than the sample rate \, and also counterproductive
to generate them at the audio rate \, because the CPU cost would be
huge and we have audio objects for that.;
#X text 533 176 Notwidstandingly \, another issue is that not all audio
objects in Pd have inlets that accept audio signals. The [lop~] object
below \, which is a lowpass filter \, only accepts control data for
the cutoff frequency., f 59;
#X text 542 435 In this case \, it doesn't really matter if control
data can be generated at a higher rate \, because only one control
value for the cutoff frequency will affect the audio block output.
, f 59;
#X text 543 498 So even tough Pd does not restrict a minimum control
rate \, this structure where control messages can only affect a block
of audio once generates an intrinsical control rate for Pd that also
depends on the block size and sample rate!;
#X text 48 23 we've seen how audio objects operate in the Sample Rate.
Computer music systems commonly have a distinction between a given
sample rate and a control rate (which is the rate that control messages
will be processed). In this case \, the audio rate is the maximum resolution
rate and the control rate is supposed to be much lower.;
