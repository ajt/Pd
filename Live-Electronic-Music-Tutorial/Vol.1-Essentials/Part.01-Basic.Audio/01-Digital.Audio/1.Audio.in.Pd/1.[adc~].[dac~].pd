#X text 32 28 The audio input/output objects in Pd are \, respectively
\, [adc~] (from "Analog to Digital Converter") and [dac~] (from "Digital
to Analog Converter")., f 55;
#X text 196 90 audio input;
#X text 32 166 The names indicate that Pd considers itself as a digital
audio station \, which is nothing but true \, but also indicates that
whatever incoming and outcoming audio is analog \, which is not necessarily
true., f 56;
#X text 32 232 The fact is that these objects communicate with audio
drivers and sound cards in your audio configurations \, so it then
depends on wheter it has analog and/or digital in/outputs and how many
of them. Most audio cards will have analog in/outs and it'sin the audio
card that the analo x digital conversion actually takes place \, not
in Pd., f 56;
#X text 31 340 By default \, [adc~] and [dac~] deal with stereo in/out
\, which are numbered as "1" and "2" \, but you can define other channels
with the arguments., f 56;

#X text 459 137 The first two inlets are the audio connection to the
left and right outputs. Above \, click and drag the slider. If your
system is configured with an audio sound card connected to speakers
\, you should listem the oscillator at 440 Hertz!, f 61;
#X text 479 376 Note that the [out~] object automatically turns the
DSP On when dragging the slider \, and that it has a toggle for turning
the DSP On and Off. The [setdsp~] object from ELSE may also turn the
audio on and off with a toggle so audio objects can operate. It also
force the audio to be turned on or off when we open the patch. Check
its help file., f 58;
#X text 459 30 The ELSE library \, that you were told to install in
the last example \, if you haven't already \, contains the [out~] object
\, which is in fact just a Pd patch (an abstraction) with [dac~] inside.
This is just for convenience and uses the default stereo output configuration
(output channels 1 and 2). Check its help file., f 61;
