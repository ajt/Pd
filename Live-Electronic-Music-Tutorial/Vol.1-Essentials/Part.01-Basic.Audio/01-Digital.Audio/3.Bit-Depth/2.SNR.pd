#X text 36 26 By converting an analog signal into a digital one \,
we need to approximate the values to the possible ones according to
the bit depth. This process is called "Quantization" and generates
a floor noise. The bigger the bit depth \, the lower the noise floor.
And this is the most important factor of the bit depth!, f 76;
#X text 36 104 The noise floor is what defines the dynamic range \,
expressed as the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). This is the ratio betwen
the maximum possible amplitude and the noise floor generated by the
quantization error. This ratio is given in dB (decibels)., f 76;

#X text 36 174 Each bit provides a dynamic range of 6.0206 dB \, which
is the same proportion of twice as much. Hence \, 16 bits gives us
a dynamic range of about 96.33 dB. 24 bits would be 144.5 dB \, which
would be crazy and \, as discussed \, not actually possible even in
sound cards that say they operate with 24 bits resolution. Considering
a more plausible maximum of 20/21 bits \, we have about 120 dB and
a bit over., f 76;
