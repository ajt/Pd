#X text 30 121 There are two types of external libraries \, they either
come compiled in a single binary pack or each object comes as a separate
binary. The first case is the classic library format and needs to be
loaded in Pd's startup (Preferences => Startup). The second case doesn't
need any of that but you need to add the library's folder to the search
paths (Preferences => Path)., f 49;

#X text 397 119 For single binaries \, as is the case with else \,
you can also use "namespaces" \, this means loading the external by
setting a relative path \, such as:;
#X obj 612 160 else/fbdelay~;
#X text 393 27 Here is an example on how to use [declare] and some
examples of external objects from "else".;
#X text 30 28 You can download and install many externals directly
from the "Help => Find Externals" menu. Just search for the name of
an external or external library ("else" \, for example) and get it.
Externals get usually downloaded to Pd's externals folder and need
to be loaded properly., f 49;
#X text 30 238 A different method is to use the [declare] object to
load both kinds of libraries with the "-lib" and "-path" flags. This
loads the libraries just for the patch containing the [declare] object.
Hence \, adding to the Path or Statup installs permanently and you
can use in any patch., f 49;
#X text 30 327 If you haven't \, please download "else" \, which is
needed for this tutorial and widely used from this point forward. It's
a library that comes with separate binaries \, so it must be added
to the search paths., f 49;
#X text 397 194 This will only work if the folder containing the external
library is included in a folder that Pd automatically searches for
files \, as is the case with Pd's externals folder \, the usual folder
for externals in Pd., f 59;
#X obj 476 389 sigmund~;
#X text 397 262 In techical terms \, an external is any object not
part of Pd's binary. Pd Vanilla itself includes extra objects that
are technically externals and they're included in a folder called "extra"
inside Pd's application \, which is searched automatically. One example
is the [sigmund~] object. Abstractions are also externals and Pd also
provides some of those in the "extra" folder \, like the reverb objects.
