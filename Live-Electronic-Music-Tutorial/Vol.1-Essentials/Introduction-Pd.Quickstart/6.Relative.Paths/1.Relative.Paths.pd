#X text 36 32 Pd can load files and externals in a patch. You can specify
an absolute directory for that \, which is a complete path \, from
root \, whic is not very convenient., f 60;
#X text 36 85 But Pd automatically searches for these in specific folders
\, so we can use them or folders that are realtive to them instead.
In order of priority \, these folders are \; - A) The folder where
the patch is saved \; - B) User Added Paths (set in Pd => Preferences
=> Path) \; - C) Pd’s Standard Path (a.k.a. the “extra” folder
inside Pd’s Application).;
#X text 36 200 When specifying relative paths \, you can use the prefix
"./" that specifies "this folder" \, which is not needed as it is implicitly
defined when we don't use it. The “../” prefix \, on the other
hand \, refers to the parent directory \, and “../../” is the parent’s
parent directory and so on…, f 60;
#X text 36 280 These can be expanded to subfolders. If you have a prefix
like “files/” (or “./files”) \, Pd searches inside a subfolder
named “files” in A) \, B) and C). Conversely \, something like
“../files” will look in a subfolder named “files” in the parent
patch as relative to A) \, B) and C).;

#X text 488 19 As an example we send the "read" message to an array
\, where Pd looks for a "table.txt" file inside a subfolder named "txt".
Since the file is included in a folder in option "A)" \, this task
is done successfuly. The write message works in the same way \, following
the priorities., f 51;
