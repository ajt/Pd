#X text 77 45 An allpass filter does not affect the frequency response
\, only the phase. This filter will be better presented in a later
and more advanced section on filters. There we'll also get into more
details on how to calculate biquad coefficients \, other filter types
and more about filters in general., f 62;
#X text 77 126 In this example \, in order to show how an allpass filter
can affect the sound \, we sum a noise input to the filtered output
\, which cancels frequencies by phase opposition \, rather like a bandstop
filter., f 62;
#X text 61 449 The resonant frequency is the point at which the pahse
is shifted to 180ยบ \, so it is the frequency point we have a full
phase cancellation. This is also considered a kind of resonant filter
because the the steepness of phase distortion is determined by the
Q parameter. In the context of this example \, where it acts like a
bandstop filter \, it is like the Q parameter controls the bandwidth
of the band rejection., f 69;
