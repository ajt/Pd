#X text 42 98 Here we have Pd set to run at 44.1 Khz via the [sr~]
object \, but we're playing a file with a sample rate of 88.2 Khz.
Hence it has twice as much samples and the playing speed drops in half
and an octave lower.;
#X text 39 358 A workaround to read a sound file with a different sample
rate is possible with resampling. In the subpatch above we have a 2x
upsampling \, which makes it possible to play at the right speed (it'd
also be possible to play a 96 Khz file when runnong Pd at 48 khz with
2x upsampling \, or even a 192 Khz file with 4x oversampling).;
#X text 41 15 For sound files to be played correctly with [tabplay~]
and [readsf~] (or [play.file~] by extension) \, Pd needs to run at
the same sample rate as the sound file's. Or else it'll play at a different
speed. By the way \, most of the sound files used on this tutorial
are at 44.1 Khz \, the usual one.;
